<p>Having mismatched character sets and collations can cause all kinds of weird display problems on a web site. The default character set for MySQL is <fixedpre>latin1</fixedpre> and the default collation is <fixedpre>latin1_swedish_ci</fixedpre>. If your CMS is using <fixedpre>utf8</fixedpre>, weird characters can appear in the output (especially for foreign-language words with accents) and sometimes searches will fail for unknown reasons.</p>

<p>I've tried converting databases from latin1 to utf8 several times over the last two years using various scripts available on the web, with no great success and often a lot of grief. Most existing scripts do the conversion but require you to drop indexes manually and often lose comments and some field characteristics (e.g. NOT NULL, UNIQUE, DEFAULT). This script drops and adds the indexes automatically and preserves the field information (including compound-key indexes).</p>

<p>I finally wrote my own script to do it. The script in this package should convert from any charset/collation
to any other charset/collation. By default it converts the current charset/collation to utf8/utf8_general_ci.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I consider character sets to be a black art, so I can't claim I fully understand this process.
I'm not sure all the steps are necessary, but the method worked for me and a number of others. YMMV.</p>

<h3>Quick and Daring Method</h3>

<p>If you completely trust this script (not recommended), this method will give you a fast conversion to UTF-8 for your database. I would still back up the database first.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Back up your database by selecting Export in PhpMyAdmin and save to a file.</li>
    <li>Create a file called cdc.config.php based on the config.cdc.sample.php file.</li>
    <li>Set the appropriate variables in the config file.</li>
    <li>Make sure the database is not in use during the rest of this process.</li>
    <li>Execute the script in a code editor, in a browser, or from the command line.</li>
    <li>If you use a browser, set <fixedpre>$convertNewlines</fixedpre> to true in the config file.</li>

    <li>In cPanel (or the equivalent) go into PhpMyAdmin and select your database.</li>
    <li>Paste the MySQL code into the SQL window of PhpMyAdmin and click on the &quot;Go&quot; button</li>
    <li>Be patient, it takes a while to run.</li>

</ol>


<h3>Safe Method (recommended)</h3>


<p>This method will allow you to check the oonversion before using it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Using PhpMyAdmin, &quot;Export&quot; the whole database to a local file using the default settings. Call the
   file <fixedpre>original-latin1.sql</fixedpre>. Note that this file will serve as a backup of the database in case anything
   goes wrong. Be careful not to overwrite or alter it!</li>

<li>Important: Be sure the DB is not in use for the rest of this process.</li>

<li>On the &quot;Operations&quot; tab of PhpMyAdmin, copy the database to a new database with a new name.
   Use no hyphens in the DB name.</li>

<li>Export this new database (as in step 1) to a file called <fixedpre>before.sql</fixedpre></li>

<li>(optional) using a diff program such as WinMerge, compare the <fixedpre>original-latin1.sql</fixedpre> file with the <fixedpre>before.sql</fixedpre> file. Except for the timestamp at the top, they should be identical.</li>
<li>Create a file called <fixedpre>cdc.config.php</fixedpre> based on the <fixedpre>cdc.config.sample.php</fixedpre> file.</li>

<li>Edit the variables in the config file to match your database and desired charset/collation.</li>

<li>If you will be executing the script in a browser, set <fixedpre>$convertNewlines=true</fixedpre> in the config file.</li>

<li>Run <fixedpre>cdc.php</fixedpre>, either in an editor, browser, or from the command line (<fixedpre>php cdc.php</fixedpre>). Do not run it from within a CMS that uses the database.</li>

<li>Copy just the SQL query code to the clipboard. Make sure you get all of it and copy only the lines that start with <fixedpre>ALTER TABLE</fixedpre>.</li>

<li>InPhpMyAdmin, select the new database you created above. Click on the SQL tab at the top.</li>

<li>Paste in the SQL query code and click on &quot;Go&quot;.</li>

<li>Be patient, it takes a while to run. You may or may not get a success message when it's finished. Sometimes you just see the SQL form go blank.</li>

<li>Export the database to a local SQL file called <fixedpre>after.sql</fixedpre></li>

<li>Use a diff program like WinMerge to compare the <fixedpre>original-latin1.sql</fixedpre> file and the <fixedpre>after.sql</fixedpre> file.
    (See the notes below.)</li>

<li>If everything looks good, put the new database into use. In a CMS, edit your CMS' config file to use the new charset and the new database.</li>

<li>Use your database and check for anomalous characters.</li>

<li>If there are problems you can't fix, switch back to the original database</li>

</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>NOTES: When you compare the original-latin1.sql and the after.sql files, you'll should see differences in the date and time line at the top and in the charset specifications. You may see that the order of some of the indexes has changed. This is normal and unavoidable. As long as they're all there, it's not a problem. It happens because the script has to drop some indexes and add them back. When they're added back, they may go at the end of the indexes. The actual fields in the tables should not have changed.</p>

<p>It's fairly common to have some extraneous characters in your database before and after conversion. Odd characters have a way of creeping into any MySQL database. Pasting text from Word or other Windows editors may give you some unusual apostrophes and quote marks (both single and double). Words "curly" quotes (aka "smart quotes") are an example. Usually, you can leave these alone since most modern browsers display them correctly. Generally speaking, you shouldn't edit anything unless it causes trouble in a displayed page.</p>

<p>If you have serious problems with characters that <i>do</i> show up in the display, you may need more drastic measures to fix them.</p>

<p>One method is to edit the Exported SQL file from the new database with a good editor (sometimes with a hex editor). Then create a new database with the proper encoding and collation and Import the SQL file to it. Don't edit anything unless you're sure you know it's wrong and what it should be. Don't edit anything but readable text.</p>

<p>You may see odd characters as garbage at the end of some database fields. You can leave them alone.</p>

<p>Sometimes you'll see extraneous characters that are not quotes or apostrophes -- most often, these are non-breaking spaces. They look like a capital A with a hat (^). Usually, these can be left alone. Be careful if you delete or replace them because they are a two-character sequence (C2 A0) and if you only delete one of them, the display will break at that point. Sometimes, in a regular editor, you can press delete twice to get rid of them and type a space. Sometimes, if you want them to be spaces, you'll need to use a hex editor and replace the C2 A0 combination with 20 (The space character).</p>

<p>With other odd characters, if you're sure you know what the text should be, you can just delete a section of text (delete the odd characters and one or two characters on each side of the odd ones to be sure) in a regular editor and retype it.</p>

<p>Note that in an SQL file, an apostrophe is represented by two single quotes (e.g. can''t, don''t, won''t).
Don't alter these or your Import will crash.</p>

<p>There are also some bits of code on the web for solving various kinds of character problems in a database. <fixedpre>mysql strange characters</fixedpre> and <fixedpre>mysql invisible characters</fixedpre> are good search phrases.

<p>Derek Sivers provides some good information <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2006/01/turning_mysql_data_in_latin1_t.html/">here</a> about using fairly exotic SQL queries to fix some of the problems (you can skip the first part of his article because the <fixepre>cdc.php</fixepre> script will have done that part for you).</p>


<h3>Notes for MODX Users</h3>

<p>Clear the site cache before starting. Before Exporting your database go into the Manager and empty the error log and the manager action log (not strictly necessary, but it will make it easier on the server). After Importing the converted database, edit manager/includes/config.inc.php, or for MODX Revolution core/config/config.inc.php. Change the charset to <fixedpre>utf8</fixedpre> and change the name of the database to the new one. Important: be sure to clear the site cache and your browser cache before testing the new site.</p>

<p>It's not a bad idea to do an upgrade install (be sure to uncheck all the options for installing snippets and the sample site in MODX Evolution).</p>
